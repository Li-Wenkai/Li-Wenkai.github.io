I am a 4th-year undergraduate in Astronomy at the [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/), currently a Student Intern at the [Steward Observatory](https://www.as.arizona.edu/), University of Arizona. My journey in astronomy began as a passionate amateur astronomer, an experience which culminated in a shortlist recognition from the Astronomy Photographer of the Year (2017) and solidified my ambition to become a professional astronomer.

My research is centered on the dynamic universe of time-domain astronomy, with a primary focus on **Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs)** as probes for **Intermediate-Mass Black Holes (IMBHs)**. I have led projects to refine the TDE luminosity function, forecast detection rates for future missions, and developed a novel theoretical model to explain the multi-wavelength light curves of the first confirmed IMBH-TDE, EP240222a. My research extends to the connection between TDEs and their host galaxies, particularly **Post-Starburst Galaxies (PSBs)**.

This research has been conducted at USTC within the group of Prof. [Tinggui Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=M_GqX5oAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate), under the mentorship of Prof. [Ning Jiang](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7152-3621), and at Steward Observatory under the guidance of Prof. [Ann Zabludoff](https://azabludoff.wixsite.com/home).

Beyond my research, I am committed to community contribution and science communication. As President of the USTC Association of Amateur Astronomers, I spearheaded over 40 events, leading the association to its first 5-star university ranking (the highest honor). As a mentor, I coached the Anhui provincial team to its first National Astronomy Olympiad Gold Medal, which led to an invitation to lecture for the National Training Team. My passion for mentorship also extends to serving as a USTC Admissions Volunteer and sharing my journey with high school students. To improve the research culture, I founded and developed USTC-astrXiv. This automated service enhances departmental communication by distributing a weekly digest of USTC-affiliated preprints, now serving over 80 subscribers.

I am currently seeking a Ph.D. position in Astrophysics for Fall 2026, and I am excited to contribute both my research experience and community-building spirit to a leading doctoral program.
