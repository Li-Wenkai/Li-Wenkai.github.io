I am a final-year undergraduate researcher in Astronomy at the [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/) and currently a visiting student at the [Steward Observatory](https://astro.arizona.edu/). For a detailed overview, please consult my [CV](/assets/pdf/CV_Wenkai_Li.pdf).

My journey in astronomy began as a passionate amateur astronomer, an experience which culminated in [a shortlist recognition from the Astronomy Photographer of the Year (2017)](https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/40727570)[^1] and solidified my ambition for a research career. My goal is to become a “versatile astronomer,” proficient across observation, theory, simulation, and instrument.
[^1]: For this recognition, I was credited under my English name, Kevin Li.

**Research Areas:**

- Tidal disruption events & intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs): EP240222a model, Ansky as a TDE, optical selected IMBH-TDE
- Post-starburst galaxies (PSBs): dwarf PSB
- Future survey forecasts: EP TDE detection rate, TDE luminosity function (LF)
- Astronomy tools: USTC-astrXiv
- Active galactic nuclei (AGNs).
- For a deeper dive, please see my [projects](/projects/).

This research has been conducted at USTC within the group of Prof. [Tinggui Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=M_GqX5oAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate), under the mentorship of Prof. [Ning Jiang](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7152-3621), and at Steward Observatory under the guidance of Prof. [Ann Zabludoff](https://azabludoff.wixsite.com/home).

**Beyond Research:**

- President, USTC Association of Amateur Astronomy, 2024-2025
- Invited Coach, Anhui Provincial Team (Chinese National Astronomy Olympiad), 2025
- Invited Lecturer, International Astronomy Olympiad Chinese National Training Team, 2025

I am currently seeking a Ph.D. position in Astrophysics for Fall 2026, and I am excited to contribute both my research experience and community-building spirit to a leading doctoral program.
