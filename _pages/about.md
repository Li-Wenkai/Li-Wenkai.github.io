I am a final-year undergrad in Astronomy at the [USTC](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/) and currently a visiting student at the [Steward Observatory](https://astro.arizona.edu/) ([CV](/assets/pdf/CV_Wenkai_Li.pdf)).

My journey in astronomy began as a passionate amateur astronomer, culminating in [a shortlist recognition](https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/40727570)[^1] from the Astronomy Photographer of the Year (2017) and solidifying my ambition for a research career. My goal is to become a “versatile astronomer,” proficient across observation, theory, simulation, and instrument.

[^1]: For this recognition, I was credited under my English name, Kevin Li.

**Research Areas:**

- Tidal Disruption Events & Intermediate-Mass Black Holes: EP240222a model, Ansky as a TDE
- Post-Starburst Galaxies: dwarf PSB
- Future Survey Forecasts: EP TDE detection rate, TDE luminosity function
- Astronomy Tools: USTC-astrXiv
- Active Galactic Nuclei: review on MCMC & AGN (in Chinese)
- For a deeper dive, please see my [projects](/projects/).

My research has been conducted at USTC under the mentorship of Prof. [Ning Jiang](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7152-3621) (Prof. [Tinggui Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=M_GqX5oAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate)'s group), and at Steward Observatory guided by Prof. [Ann Zabludoff](https://azabludoff.wixsite.com/home).

**Beyond Research:**

- President, USTC Association of Amateur Astronomy (2024-2025)
- Invited Coach, Chinese National Astronomy Olympiad Anhui Provincial Team (2025)
- Invited Lecturer, International Astronomy Olympiad Chinese National Training Team (2025)

I am currently seeking a Ph.D. position in Astrophysics for Fall 2026, and I am excited to contribute both my research experience and community-building spirit to a leading doctoral program.
