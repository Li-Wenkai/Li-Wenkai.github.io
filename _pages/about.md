Hi! I am a final-year undergrad in Astronomy at the [USTC](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/) and currently a visiting student at the [Steward Observatory](https://astro.arizona.edu/). For details, consult my [CV](/assets/pdf/CV_Wenkai_Li.pdf).

My journey began as an amateur astronomer, culminating in [a shortlisting by the Astronomy Photographer of the Year](https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/40727570)[^1] and solidifying research ambition. My goal is to become a “versatile astronomer,” skilled in observation, theory, simulation and instrument.

[^1]: For this recognition, I was credited under my English name, Kevin Li.

My research is mentored by [Prof. Ning Jiang](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7152-3621) in [Prof. Tinggui Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=M_GqX5oAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate)'s research group at USTC, and by [Prof. Ann Zabludoff](https://azabludoff.wixsite.com/home) at Steward Observatory.

## Research:

- Tidal Disruption Events & Intermediate-Mass Black Holes: [EP240222a Model](/projects/#ep240222a-model), [Ansky as a TDE](/projects/#ansky-as-a-tde)
- Post-Starburst Galaxies: [dPSBs](/projects/#the-nature-of-dpsbs-on-going)
- Survey Forecasts: [EP Termal TDE Detection Rate](/projects/#ep-thermal-tde-detection-rate), [TDE & FBOT's LF & Detection Rate](/projects/#ep-thermal-tde-detection-rate)
- Astronomy Tools: [USTC-astrXiv (蜗壳天文科研周报)](/projects/#ustc-astrxiv-蜗壳天文科研周报)
- Active Galactic Nuclei: [MCMC in AGN & Cosmology](/projects/#mcmc-in-agn-and-cosmology)
- For a deeper dive, please see my [Research](/projects).

## Teaching:

- Invited Lecturer, China National Astronomy Olympiad Training, Hefei (2024 & 2025)
- Teaching Assistant, Introduction to Astronomy ([Prof. Yongquan Xue](https://faculty.ustc.edu.cn/xueyongquan/zh_CN/index.htm)), USTC (2024 Fall)
- Invited Lecturer, International Astronomy Olympiad Chinese National Training Team, USTC (2024)
- Invited Coach, Chinese National Astronomy Olympiad Anhui Provincial Team, Hefei No. 1 HS (2024)
- Invited Lecturer, Astronomy Summer Course, Shenzhen Middle School Astronomy Association (2021)

## Hobby:

- Amateur Astronomy
- Daily Photography
- Sports
- Travel

## Outreach:

- President & Vice President, USTC Association of Amateur Astronomy (2023 - 2025)
- Admissions Volunteer, USTC Undergraduate Admissions (2022 & 2024)
- Invited Speaker, Shenzhen Middle School Mathematics and Science High School Study Tour (2023)

I am currently seeking a Ph.D. position in Astronomy for Fall 2026, and I am excited to contribute both my research experience and community-building spirit to a leading doctoral program.
