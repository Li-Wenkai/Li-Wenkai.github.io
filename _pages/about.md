Hi! I am a final-year undergrad in Astronomy at the [USTC](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/) and currently a visiting student at the [Steward Observatory](https://astro.arizona.edu/). For details, consult my [CV](/assets/pdf/CV_Wenkai_Li.pdf).

My journey began as an amateur astronomer, culminating in [a shortlisting by the Astronomy Photographer of the Year](https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/40727570)[^1] and solidifying research ambition. My goal is to become a “versatile astronomer,” skilled in observation, theory, simulation and instrument.

[^1]: For this recognition, I was credited under my English name, Kevin Li.

My research is mentored by Prof. [Ning Jiang](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7152-3621) (Prof. [Tinggui Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=M_GqX5oAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate)'s group) at USTC, and by Prof. [Ann Zabludoff](https://azabludoff.wixsite.com/home) at Steward Observatory.

## Research Areas:

- Tidal Disruption Events & Intermediate-Mass Black Holes: EP240222a model, Ansky as a TDE
- Post-Starburst Galaxies: dwarf PSBs
- Future Survey Forecasts: EP TDE detection rate, TDE luminosity functions
- Astronomy Tools: USTC-astrXiv
- Active Galactic Nuclei: review on MCMC & AGN (in Chinese)
- For a deeper dive, please see my [Research](/projects/).

## Beyond Research:

- President, USTC Association of Amateur Astronomy (2024-2025)
- Invited Coach, Chinese National Astronomy Olympiad Anhui Provincial Team (2025)
- Invited Lecturer, International Astronomy Olympiad Chinese National Training Team (2025)

I am currently seeking a Ph.D. position in Astronomy for Fall 2026, and I am excited to contribute both my research experience and community-building spirit to a leading doctoral program.
