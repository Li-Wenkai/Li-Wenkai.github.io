This review paper, written in Chinese for [Prof. Guilin Liu](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~glliu/)’s graduate course _Statistical Methods in Astrophysics_, was co-authored by Jialai Wang, Tianyi Wei, Shihong Liu and me, with equal contributions.

I wrote the introductory chapter, which provides an overview of the fundamental concepts of AGNs and MCMC methods, laying the theoretical foundation for the subsequent chapters.

Note: The references are incomplete, as certain textbooks, lecture notes, and slides were omitted due to LaTeX formatting issues.
